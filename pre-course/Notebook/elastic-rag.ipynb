Make sure no other service on your machine is running on port 5432. If there is one, stopping that service may resolve the issue.\\n\\n2. Substitute port 5432 with a different port, for example 5431, in your configurations both in the connection string and in the port mapping.\\n\\n3. Verify if you have a root user with the ability to login by using the docker exec command.\\n\\n4. If you have Postgres software installed on your computer, try building your instance on a different port, like 8080 instead of 5432.\\n\\n5. Modify your docker container port to use a different port, for example 5431, and update your connection command accordingly.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the password authentication issue when connecting to the Postgres port 5432.'"
